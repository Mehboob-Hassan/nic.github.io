# Technology Incubation Center (TIC) - Landing Page

A responsive landing page developed for the **Technology Incubation Center (TIC)** — an initiative by the **IT Department, University of Sindh**. This project was assigned to me during my **final year** as part of academic work.

> _"TIC provides emerging entrepreneurs with the opportunity to start their own businesses by offering the necessary framework, infrastructure, mentorship, and both national and international networking opportunities to help them launch and grow their enterprises."_
